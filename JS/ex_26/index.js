/*
We need to define Winnipeg using variables and all the data types that we learned
Declare at least 6 variables that will help you describe the city
Try using at least one variable of each type
Show each value using console.log() with the variable name (string) as first parameter and the actual variable value as second
Example: console.log('name', name);
Also show the variable names and the type of value it has assigned (use typeof)

console.log('cityName: ', cityName, 'population: ', population, 'inCanada: ', inCanada);
console.log('cityName: ', typeof(cityName), 'population: ', typeof(population), 'inCanada: ', typeof(inCanada));
